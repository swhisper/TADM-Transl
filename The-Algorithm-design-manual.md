# The Algorithm Design Manual

## Preface

Most professional programmers that I’ve encountered are not well prepared to tackle algorithm design problems. This is a pity, because the techniques of algorithm design form one of the core practical technologies of computer science. Designing correct, efficient, and implementable algorithms for real-world problems requires access to two distinct bodies of knowledge:

* Techniques – Good algorithm designers understand several fundamental algorithm design techniques, including data structures, dynamic programming,depth-first search, backtracking, and heuristics. Perhaps the single most important design technique is modeling, the art of abstracting a messy real-world application into a clean problem suitable for algorithmic attack.
* Resources – Good algorithm designers stand on the shoulders of giants.Rather than laboring from scratch to produce a new algorithm for every task,they can figure out what is known about a particular problem. Rather than re-implementing popular algorithms from scratch, they seek existing implementations to serve as a starting point. They are familiar with many classic algorithmic problems, which provide sufficient source material to model most any application.
