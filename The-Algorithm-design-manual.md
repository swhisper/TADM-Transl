# The Algorithm Design Manual

## Preface

Most professional programmers that I’ve encountered are not well prepared to tackle algorithm design problems. This is a pity, because the techniques of algorithm design form one of the core practical technologies of computer science. Designing correct, efficient, and implementable algorithms for real-world problems requires access to two distinct bodies of knowledge:

* Techniques – Good algorithm designers understand several fundamental algorithm design techniques, including data structures, dynamic programming,depth-first search, backtracking, and heuristics. Perhaps the single most important design technique is modeling, the art of abstracting a messy real-world application into a clean problem suitable for algorithmic attack.
* Resources – Good algorithm designers stand on the shoulders of giants.Rather than laboring from scratch to produce a new algorithm for every task,they can figure out what is known about a particular problem. Rather than re-implementing popular algorithms from scratch, they seek existing implementations to serve as a starting point. They are familiar with many classic algorithmic problems, which provide sufficient source material to model most any application.

This book is intended as a manual on algorithm design, providing access to combinatorial algorithm technology for both students and computer professionals. 



我所遇到的大多数专业程序员都没有做好处理算法设计问题的准备。这有点遗憾，因为算法的技术是构建计算机科学的一个核心实用性技术。为现实生活的问题设计正确、高效且易于执行的算法，需要了解两种独特的知识体系：

* 技术——好的算法设计师懂得好几种基本的算法设计技术，包括数据结构，动态编程，深度优先搜寻，回溯法和试探法。也许，最重要的设计技术是建模，是将麻烦的现实生活应用抽象为一个清晰的问题并通过适当的算法来解决的艺术。
* 资源——好的算法设计师站在巨人的肩膀上。不同于每天的任务那样拼凑一个新算法的劳动，他们可以解决一个众所周知的特殊问题。不同于重现抓取的流行算法，他们将探索现存的实现方法作为初始点。这与许多提供充足资源来对大多数应用建模的经典算法问题类似。
